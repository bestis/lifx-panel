LIFX Panel
===

Standalone Panel implementation for LIFX HTTP API (http://api.developer.lifx.com/docs/introduction).

It isn't complete implementation just a quick PoC with engineer designed UI.

### Installation
```
npm install
node_modules/bower/bin/bower install
```

### Notes
I'm not loving that I had to use npm and bower just to get the colorwheel, but t
his is the state of things. Otherwise it uses Javascript from CDNs.

As it needs network to communicate with LIFX, so it's all the same to use javascript from CDNs.
